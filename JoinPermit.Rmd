##  do a join between permit geocoding and my geocoding

```{r join databases}

Geotable <- readRDS("~/Dropbox/CrimeStats/CensusGeoTable_progress.rds")
Permits <- readRDS("~/Dropbox/CrimeStats/PermitDB_Geocode.rds")

Geotable <- Geotable %>% 
  select(Address, match_address, Beat, n, lat, long, geocode_status, status) %>% 
  mutate(Address=toupper(Address)) %>% 
  mutate(Address=str_remove(Address," , .*")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(lat))

Permits <- Permits %>% 
  select(Address, Lat, Lon) %>% 
  mutate(Address=str_replace(Address, "000-099", "0-99")) %>% 
  group_by(Address) %>% 
  summarise(NewLat=mean(Lat), NewLon=mean(Lon)) %>% 
  mutate(oldAddress=Address) %>% 
  mutate(Address=toupper(Address)) %>% 
  mutate(Address=str_remove(Address," , .*")) 

# Add Beat to Permits

Beats <- read_sf('/home/ajackson/Dropbox/CrimeStats/BeatPolys/Houston_Police_Beats.shp')

#   find points in polygons
#   since beats don't overlap (I hope), let's just grab the array index
#   instead of creating a huge matrix

# first make Permits an sf object

googlecrs <- 4326
Permits <- st_as_sf(Permits, coords=c("NewLon", "NewLat"),
                    crs=googlecrs, agr = "identity")
Geotable <- st_as_sf(Geotable, coords=c("long", "lat"),
                    crs=googlecrs, agr = "identity")

keep <- Permits
# intersect

Geotable <- st_join(Geotable, Beats, join=st_nn, maxdist=500) 

#   Which records have conflicting beat information?

Geotable_conflicts <- Geotable %>% 
  filter(Beats!=Beat)

Permits <- st_join(Permits, Beats, join=st_nn, maxdist=500) 

Permits <- Permits %>% 
  select(Address, oldAddress, Beats)
                      
#   Final join of permit data to crime data

Final <- full_join(Geotable, Permits, by="Address")

```


##    Test output in various ways

- Look at distance distribution between nominally similar points
- Count unique addresses for both input datasets
- compare distances census vs google against permits

```{r test data}

Final <- Final %>% 
  mutate(dist=sqrt((((lat-NewLat)*364191)**2) +
                   ((long-NewLon)*311695)**2)) 
  skim()
  ggplot(aes(x=dist)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=10)

```
