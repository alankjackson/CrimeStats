Plans


- Make geocoding file
   - blank out generated locations and then add back, * done 22 Aug 2019
   - intersect unmatched with:
      - zipcode
      - census tract
      - neighborhood

     Source (census, google, manual, generated), Status (success, failed, impossible)
     
  - Make neural net training set (similar but also include raw address)
  
- Build geocoding package
   - use file from above
   - add in census and google code as well
